# Trent Morrell's Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, hosted at [trentmorrell.netlify.app](https://trentmorrell.netlify.app).

## About the Site

This personal website serves as my online portfolio and resume, showcasing my projects, skills, and professional experience. Built with React, it features a responsive design that works across desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- HTML5/CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Netlify for hosting and continuous deployment
